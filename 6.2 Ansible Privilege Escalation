After the modification, execute the playbook again to enable the user zhangsan to have
the privilege escalation capability.
Step 2 Configure password-free login.
Set the password-free login permission for the user zhangsan on the controller.
Step 3 Modify the role file.
Modify the playbook in step 7 in the section "Usage of Roles" as follows:
- hosts: all
 remote_user: zhangsan
 gather_facts: true
 roles:
 - role: httpd
 become: true
 become_method: sudo
 become_user: root
 become_ask_pass: false
After the modification, run the playbook to check whether it can run properly.
