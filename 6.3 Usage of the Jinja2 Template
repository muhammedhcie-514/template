Example: Based on the chapter "Usage of Ansible Roles", change the home page. If the
host name is client-1, "this is test1" is displayed. If the host name is client-2, "this is
test2" is displayed.
Modify the home page file index.html.j2 as follows:
{% if ansible_hostname == "client-1" %}
this is test1
{% elif ansible_hostname == "client-2" %}
this is test2
{% endif %}
After the modification, execute the httpd_role.yaml file again for the configuration to
take effect.
After the execution, perform a test to check whether the requirements can be met.
